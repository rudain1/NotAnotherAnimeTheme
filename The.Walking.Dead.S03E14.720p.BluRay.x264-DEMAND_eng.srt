1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,823
( raspy breathing )

2
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,498
Almost done.

3
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,976
( sighs )

4
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,370
Here.

5
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,743
If only we had some cab'.

6
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,099
Girls' night.

7
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,741
( chains rattling )

8
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,063
Boys are getting
restless again.

9
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,854
You still haven't told me,

10
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,990
where did you find them?

11
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,063
Did they attack?
Did you hunt them down?

12
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,497
Or did you know them?

13
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,093
I'm so sorry.

14
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,937
Oh, God.

15
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,369
You want to talk about it?

16
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,659
( sniffles )

17
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,651
Okay.

18
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,214
They deserved
what they got.

19
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,301
They weren't human
to begin with.

20
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,134
( clanking )

21
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,265
( breathing heavily )

22
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,938
( theme music playing )

23
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,789
- You, grab the .50.
- You got it.

24
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,977
The Governor wants all this?

25
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,018
- He wants options.
- Where is he now?

26
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,138
Not here.

27
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,867
- How many are going out?
- Everybody.

28
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,143
I thought there was
a deal on the table.

29
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,779
I'm sure it's just a precaution,
a show of force.

30
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,940
Milton.

31
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,771
Milton!

32
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,378
You need something?

33
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,650
What is that?

34
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,858
It's my workshop.

35
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,214
How does that help
Woodbury?

36
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,643
Excuse me?

37
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,053
This was supposed
to be a new start,

38
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,017
a way out.

39
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,770
What about everything
we talked about?

40
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,782
Beating this thing?
Clawing our way back?

41
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,418
Look, this business
with Michonne,

42
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,130
I understand.

43
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,052
But the people
at the prison...

44
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,581
What?

45
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,135
Hmm?

46
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,580
- I should move on?
- Yes.

47
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,377
Well, I will
as soon as this is over.

48
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,935
- Philip...
- Let me ask you something, huh?

49
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,667
Do you still believe the biters
have some spark in them, huh?

50
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,491
Of who they were?

51
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,974
I think so.

52
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,701
Then that was
my daughter, wasn't it?

53
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,232
Whether that was
Penny or not,

54
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,534
it's done.

55
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,455
- It doesn't matter.
- Oh...

56
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,461
it's all that matters.

57
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,864
There is no deal.
Philip's asked for Michonne.

58
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,300
Rick would never
agree to that.

59
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,090
Whether he hands
her over or not,

60
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,655
he's gonna kill them all.

61
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,662
- I have to stop this.
- I don't think you can.

62
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,060
Leave.

63
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,822
Tell the people at the prison
to get out of there.

64
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,099
In time, he'll move on.

65
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,890
No.

66
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,172
I have to kill him.

67
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,815
You'll never
get close to him.

68
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,978
They'll gun you down first.

69
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,580
Only if they see me coming.

70
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,698
Milton, this is sick.

71
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,421
I can't just stand back
and watch this.

72
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,975
( door opens )

73
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,142
( floor creaks )

74
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,749
( whistling )

75
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,422
( rewinding )

76
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,414
( whistling on tape )

77
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,855
( rewinding )

78
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,024
( whistling on tape )

79
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,017
How can you
still protect him?

80
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,334
He doesn't give a shit
about you.

81
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,067
I knew Philip before
he became the Governor.

82
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,247
That man still exists.

83
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,217
I don't believe that.

84
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,372
Okay, so you kill
the Governor.

85
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,101
Then you get shot
and Martinez takes over.

86
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,459
What then?

87
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,383
Killing the Governor
doesn't save your friends.

88
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,268
Then I have to go back.
Warn them.

89
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,136
And you're coming with me.

90
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,850
I can't leave Woodbury.

91
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,851
You really want
to be a part of this?

92
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,657
I don't know anyone
at the prison.

93
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,824
So what?
You know Merle. He fit in.

94
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,817
You'll be fine.

95
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,572
Like it or not,
I belong here.

96
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,778
Then if you stay,

97
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,782
you can't keep looking
the other way.

98
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,098
Take care of yourself.

99
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,374
You got any other weapons?

100
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:13,078
<i>Do you have more rounds?
What do you guys got?</i>

101
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,776
Andrea.

102
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,179
Andrea!

103
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,152
Governor wants
all weapons collected.

104
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,957
Got to get the team
geared up.

105
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,657
I think
I'm more helpful armed.

106
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,698
Hand over your piece
and any ammo.

107
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,531
No.

108
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,290
Let's not be stupid
about this.

109
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,975
Hand over your piece.

110
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,409
You got a knife?

111
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,332
You want to frisk me?

112
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,180
I should have told you
about all this. I'm sorry.

113
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,654
I just, uh...

114
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,422
I want to keep you
separate from this.

115
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,871
Safe.
You understand?

116
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,012
Yeah.

117
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,690
I just want to help.

118
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,093
Well, you can.
Tomorrow.

119
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,102
I want you with us
when we go and meet Rick.

120
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,551
He tries anything,
you can talk some sense into him.

121
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,888
Tries anything?

122
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,259
Well, you trust them,
I don't.

123
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,855
Understood.

124
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,139
I'll be there.

125
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,096
You take this one.

126
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,367
( walker growling )

127
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,498
You need the practice.

128
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,371
Just relax.

129
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,463
How am I gonna relax
if you keep telling me to relax?

130
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,410
Wasn't even close.

131
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,296
- You want to do this?
- I have been.

132
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,498
( gunshot )

133
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,893
You're wasting ammo.

134
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,451
( gunshot )

135
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,497
( gunshot )
- Got him.

136
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,538
Nice shot.

137
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,589
( laughs )

138
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,180
Hey, large pack
of walkers was spotted

139
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,011
heading for the main wall.

140
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,069
Martinez wants some help.
I got this covered.

141
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,936
We're not supposed
to leave this post.

142
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,897
Ask Martinez.
I'm just doing what I'm told.

143
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,535
You got to bring him over.
We need to hear it from him.

144
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,658
- You're wasting time.
<i>- Sasha: Why can't you handle it?</i>

145
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,376
You're supposed
to be a good shot.

146
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,094
- What are you doing?
- Got to get out of here.

147
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,016
- Nobody leaves.
- Please, I don't want any trouble.

148
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,293
- What is this about?
- Just get out of my way.

149
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,107
- Don't.
- Relax.

150
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,862
Nobody's got
to get hurt here.

151
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,658
I'm sorry.

152
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,381
I'm sorry, it's just
this place is...

153
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,018
- I can't stay here.
- Why?

154
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,701
The Governor, he is not
what he seems to be.

155
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,059
- He seems pretty straight up to me.
- That's what I thought, too.

156
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,741
But I'm telling you,
he has done terrible things.

157
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,731
He's planning worse.

158
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,261
I've got to get out of here
and you should, too.

159
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,223
Look, you're rattled,
exhausted.

160
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,539
Just put the knife down.

161
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,893
I'm going.

162
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,216
Okay.

163
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,735
We shouldn't have
let her go.

164
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,467
What do you want me
to do, shoot her?

165
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,456
- You should have stopped her.
- Stop her how?

166
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,417
- Shoot her in the back?
- No, you did the right thing.

167
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,929
Thank God neither
of you were hurt.

168
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,380
We stand on that wall
to stop biters,

169
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,659
not keep people in.

170
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,743
This isn't
a prison camp, is it?

171
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,145
Of course not. It's just she's in no
shape to take care of herself.

172
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,454
Seems pretty capable to me.

173
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,380
She was out there
all winter

174
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,015
alone.

175
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,098
Can you imagine?

176
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,815
Now, you two had each other
or your friends.

177
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,582
She only had the biters.

178
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,855
We brought her in
and tried to help her,

179
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,369
but it was too late.

180
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,061
She'd been out there
too long.

181
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,305
Did she...
Did she say anything?

182
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,776
- Like what?
- I don't know.

183
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,617
Like what panicked her?

184
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,891
No.

185
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,213
I hope this
doesn't affect us.

186
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,689
What do you mean?

187
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,864
Well, we heard she was
with that prison group.

188
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,748
I hope I didn't
complicate things.

189
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,812
No. No.

190
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,662
Um, look,
I'll tell you what.

191
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,869
Martinez here could use
a hand with something.

192
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,212
If you wouldn't mind
helping him out, I'd appreciate it.

193
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,681
- Of course.
- Thank you.

194
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,337
( door opens )

195
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,732
Is she gone?

196
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,371
They going after her?

197
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,050
No.

198
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,212
I am.

199
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,812
Oh.

200
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,696
You have a problem
with that, too?

201
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,253
Let her go.

202
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,659
Why would I do that?

203
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,732
She just wants
to be with her people.

204
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,535
You talked to her?

205
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,854
No.

206
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,138
You did.

207
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,740
You knew she was leaving,
didn't you?

208
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,973
She told me.

209
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,692
What else did you two
talk about, huh?

210
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,904
Did you tell her
about the deal?

211
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,627
Did you tell her
about Michonne?

212
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,981
She knows, doesn't she?

213
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,744
( panting )

214
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,421
( walkers growling )

215
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,807
Hey.

216
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,012
Be ready to roll in a few.

217
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,218
Where to?

218
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,372
We're not going
after that girl, are we?

219
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,371
What if we were?
Is that a problem?

220
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,337
She was pretty shook up.

221
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,056
She definitely
didn't want to be here.

222
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:22,304
Look, she's on her own,
understood?

223
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,659
We got something else.

224
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,410
It's sort of
hard to explain.

225
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,774
Just be at the truck
in five.

226
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,301
- Okay.
- What girl?

227
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,171
Andrea jumped the wall.

228
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,947
On your watch?
And you let her go?

229
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,667
Hey, man, these guys
have been talking.

230
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,169
She's trouble.

231
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,137
Maybe she's not the issue.

232
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,574
She said some
pretty crazy shit.

233
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,870
You know why?
'Cause she's crazy.

234
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,500
Hey, don't screw this
up for us.

235
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,308
- I'm just looking out.
- For you two, maybe.

236
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,620
What the hell
are you talking about?

237
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,292
We got a good thing here.

238
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,960
I don't want to get
tossed out because of you.

239
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,418
These guys are on edge.

240
00:18:06,475 --> 00:18:08,275
They've been attacked
by that crazy-ass cowboy

241
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,180
and some chick with a sword.

242
00:18:09,185 --> 00:18:10,940
Shit's going down
and you're making waves.

243
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,932
We just have to get
with the program.

244
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:15,229
I am.

245
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:17,538
That guy doesn't trust you.

246
00:18:17,675 --> 00:18:19,663
Do not screw this up.

247
00:18:19,795 --> 00:18:22,058
Ease back, man.

248
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:25,140
Or what?

249
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:27,953
You need to shame me
in front of my boy again?

250
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:30,585
Don't go there, man.

251
00:18:30,715 --> 00:18:33,185
Donna...

252
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:35,544
I just happened
to be there.

253
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:38,180
- It could have been anyone.
- But it wasn't, was it?

254
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:41,153
- It was you.
- You want to do this now?

255
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:43,780
A long time coming.

256
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,306
You guys catch up.

257
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:48,217
Come on, Ben.

258
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:54,635
Yeah, it was me.
I saved her life.

259
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:56,300
Right place, right time.

260
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,115
And from that moment, she was
glued to you like a lost puppy.

261
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:01,980
Her knight
in shining armor.

262
00:19:02,115 --> 00:19:04,264
It made me feel like...

263
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:08,535
- I could have done it.
- I know you could've.

264
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:10,222
- She didn't.
- Of course she did.

265
00:19:10,355 --> 00:19:13,757
She knew that.
She was just scared, that's all.

266
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:18,575
This ain't got nothing
to do with you or me.

267
00:19:18,835 --> 00:19:21,895
Yo, I said five.

268
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,871
Let's go.
Fire it up.

269
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,469
We ain't done.

270
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,834
( engine starts )

271
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,441
( panting )

272
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,672
( car approaching )

273
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,195
( exhales )

274
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:06,243
( breathing heavily )

275
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,112
( snarling )

276
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,349
( grunts )

277
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,875
Shit.

278
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,004
( walkers snarling )

279
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,789
<i>Sasha:
What is that?</i>

280
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,631
<i>Martinez:
Jackpot, baby.</i>

281
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,677
This some kind
of extermination?

282
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,315
You could say that.
No weeding out today, Shump.

283
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,518
- The more the merrier.
- All right.

284
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,655
You got a use for them?

285
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,129
Honey, we got a use
for everything.

286
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,930
This got something to do
with that meeting tomorrow?

287
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,210
The one with the prison group?

288
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,767
Ho, ho, ho.
Get that man a prize.

289
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,602
- You're bringing biters?
- Allen, heads up.

290
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,350
Okay, this is genius.

291
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,488
Hey, kid, grab the collars
out of the truck.

292
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,135
This ain't right.

293
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,170
Didn't think we were gonna
have any problems today, fella.

294
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,110
I didn't think we'd be
feeding people to biters.

295
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:43,793
What do you care?
They're rats.

296
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,622
This is sick.

297
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,518
Hey, give me a hand here.
Ty, you deaf?

298
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,708
I'm not doing this.

299
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,667
They got women
and children.

300
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,179
You can't do this.

301
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,538
Fine, suit yourself.

302
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,507
We get back,
you tell the Governor.

303
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,950
He'll send you packing.
Send you all packing.

304
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,505
- There's no need for that.
- Relax.

305
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,478
We looked out for each other.
We'll do it again.

306
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,312
We'll get out of your way
if that's what you want.

307
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,658
You don't speak for us.

308
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,627
You're not sending my boy
out there again.

309
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,277
- I look out for him.
- Like you looked out for Donna?

310
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,708
( grunts )

311
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,708
<i>- Sasha: Tyreese!
- Leave him alone!</i>

312
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,701
Get off me!

313
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,388
Do it.

314
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,149
Go on!

315
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,786
Please.

316
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,023
Go on!

317
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,389
You okay?

318
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,621
( clapping )

319
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,461
You've all been
very productive.

320
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,461
Shump,
take 'em back to town.

321
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,991
Let 'em do some knitting.

322
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,683
( breathing heavily )

323
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,877
( engine revving )

324
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,078

( engine revving )

329
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,661
( clatters )
- Shit.

330
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,225
( engine revs )

331
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,662
( engine turns off )

332
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,862
( car door slams )

333
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,225
( clatters )

334
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,321
( metal clanking )

335
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,278
( whistling )

336
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,740
( snarling )

337
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,339
( fence rattles )

338
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,592
( quietly )
Andrea.

339
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,541
Come back with me.

340
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,909
Come back to Woodbury.

341
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,741
We need you.

342
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,230
We all need you.

343
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,200
( louder )
That's your home now.

344
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,982
Your people.

345
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,184
Your town.

346
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,352
You can't just leave
'em all behind.

347
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,800
Please, Andrea, come home.

348
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,228
Suit yourself.

349
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,958
( glass shattering )

350
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,438
( rattling )

351
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,358
( whistling )

352
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,154
( shovel scraping )

353
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,391
( clattering )

354
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,799
( snarling )

355
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,703
( gunshot )

356
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,861
( gunshot )

357
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,269
( snarling )

358
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,309
( shovel banging )

359
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,078
( fence rattles )

360
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,278
( footsteps )

361
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,112
( snarling )

362
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,481
( snarling echoing )

363
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,424
Time to go home, huh?

364
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,900
Andrea.

365
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,869
( snarling )

366
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,988
( grunts )

367
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,825
( gunshots )

368
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,064
( gunshots continue )

369
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,262
( gun clicking )

370
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,584
Come on!
Come on!

371
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,595
( Governor screaming )

372
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,466
Shh.

373
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,940
Yeah.

374
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,022
Shh.

375
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,785
( snarling )

376
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,262
Did you find her?

377
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,101
No luck.

378
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,424
Just got word.
Someone barbecued the pit biters.

379
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,100
Who?

380
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,148
Got a few shit stirrers
in the bunch.

381
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,947
Tyreese and his sister.

382
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,343
Send them over to distro.

383
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,468
- Rest of the group, too.
- All right.

384
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,944
We're still gonna need biters,
so get some more.

385
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,183
You got it.

386
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,671
( door opens )

387
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,901
Sorry to keep you waiting.

388
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,339
Did you find her?

389
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,871
No.

390
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,597
Hardly made it back myself.

391
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,872
I'll look again tomorrow.

392
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,197
So I heard there was
a little hang-up at the pits.

393
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,664
You got a beef with Rick,
that's fair enough.

394
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,753
But you can't be feeding
his kids to biters.

395
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,702
No one's feeding anyone
to biters.

396
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,201
Well, I saw the trailers.

397
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,641
It's a scare tactic.
It's a bluff.

398
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,001
I'd rather scare his people
into leaving us alone

399
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,464
than engaging
in another fight.

400
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,829
I'm trying
to save lives here.

401
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,945
They're just for show?

402
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,585
You know, people are more
afraid of a biter on a leash

403
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,742
than a gun in their face.

404
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,263
It's pretty effective.

405
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,038
Then why didn't your man
just say that?

406
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,670
'Cause...

407
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,708
we don't discuss
tactics with people

408
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,271
that we don't really know.

409
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,240
( sighs )
Governor, look.

410
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,509
I shoot my mouth off
sometimes,

411
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,398
but the truth is
we want to stay.

412
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,437
I saw red.
It won't happen again.

413
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,982
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

414
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,390
Where did you get
the gasoline?

415
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,063
Come again?

416
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,230
Doesn't matter.

417
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,344
Is she dead?

418
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,743
I hope not.

419
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,707
Are you okay?

420
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,431
Never been better.

421
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,639
It's a real shame
about the pits.

422
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,233
You heard about that, huh?

423
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,232
I hope you find out
who did it.

424
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,828
Already have.

425
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,065
